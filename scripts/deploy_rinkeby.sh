# artifacts and update them with the newly deployed contract
# addresses, saving the newest artifacts in build.dev

# Thus, when pushing a new build to Rinkeby, we want to replace build
# folder with most recent saved  production artifacts/ directory contents
# so that our new artifacts include the addresses of contracts deployed in production
# on networks *other* than Rinkeby.
